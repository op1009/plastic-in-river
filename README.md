# Custom YOLO Model for Plastic Waste Detection in Rivers

This repository contains the code and resources to train a custom YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) model for detecting plastic waste in river environments. The model is trained to identify plastic waste in river images and classify them in one of 'PLASTIC_BAG', 'PLASTIC_BOTTLE', 'OTHER_PLASTIC_WASTE', 'NOT_PLASTIC_WASTE' classes.

## Dataset
- `plastic_in_river` from [HuggingFaceðŸ¤—](https://huggingface.co/datasets/kili-technology/plastic_in_river)

## Training
- Configure the YOLO model parameters in the configuration file according to your dataset and requirements.
- Train the model using the provided scripts or customize them as needed.
- Monitor the training progress and adjust hyperparameters if necessary.

## Inference
- Use the trained model to perform inference on new images to detect plastic waste in river.
